      "Neuroscience research has confirmed that just 8 weeks of regular mindfulness meditation produces measurable changes in the brain: increased gray matter density in regions associated with self-awareness and compassion, and decreased amygdala size (the brain's alarm system). Regular practitioners show reduced cortisol levels, lower blood pressure, improved immune function, and significantly reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression.",
    tips: [
      "Start with just 5 minutes per day — consistency beats duration",
      "Use a guided app (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer)",
      "Focus on your breath — when mind wanders, gently return",
      "Practice body scan meditation before sleep to improve rest",
      "Commit to 8 weeks — that is when brain changes become measurable",
